# Assignment 1 

Complete by June 2 but there is nothing to submit.

## Installations 
1. Install Python 3.6+ on your computer 
2. Install Jupyter Notebook on your computer 
3. Install Git on your computer (already installed on Mac)

Anaconda may be the easiest way to install both Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter will be our primary environment for learning Python interactively. 

## Accounts

1. We will use `big-data-ust.slack.com` for communication. You should have received an invitation by e-mail to join.
1. We will use GitHub for submitting assignments. Create a GitHub account and provide your GitHub username to the instructor in Slack.


# Background skills

Besides learning to program in Python, several background skills will be assumed in the class but may also be acquired during the course. 
If you have not used these tools before, this may seem overwhelming. But take courage and learn them at your own pace. 
Think of this assignment as a way to familiarize yourself with the tools that will become helpful throughout the course.
You can learn them at your own pace as they become necessary. 

## Terminal Shell and Command-line utilities 

Learn about working from the command line in a unix-like command line shell. 
Although these tools were originally developed for Unix, every operating system now provides a command-line interface with these utilities. 
MacOS is a Unix-derived operating system and provides a terminal application with a command line shell. 
Windows now provides 

* Open a unix-style command-line shell: 
  - You can open a bash window from Jupyter
  - MacOS: Terminal App on MacOS. Windows 10: Bash on Windows, GitBash
  - History: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#2-a-brief-history-lesson
* Demonstrate knowledge of working with command-line utilities
  - navigate the folder structure: `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`
  - create/delete files and folders: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, `rm -r`, `mv`
  - examine files: `cat`, `more`, `less`, `diff`
  - running programs and scripts 
  - help command `man`

## Editing plain-text files

Learn to use a plain-text editor to work with program files, text files such as CSV and JSON.
Most useful are text editors that allow editing a file directly in the terminal window. 
The most popular are `vi`, `emacs`, and `nano`.  
You will need to learn one of them to streamline your workflow. 
`vi` and `emacs` require some learning before you can use them. 
`nano` is more beginner friendly.

## Git 

We will use `git` and `github` in the class. 

Learn the principles of `git` and its usage from the command line.

## Markdown
We will be learning to create formatted text using markdown in stand-alone markdown files as well as inside Jupyter files.
