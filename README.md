### Week 13 
Work with the CityLines dataset and Final Project:
* Navigate the CityLines dataset [CityLines](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/msds-5x01/python-programming-for-data-science/blob/master/notebooks/CityLines.ipynb)



### Week 15 (Nov 27) - no class - Thanksgiving

**Final:** Present Group Project.
# Final Project

Work with the citylines datasets to produce several visualizations and present them in class. 
The first four visualization are specified. Come up with four additional ones for the presentation. Describe your work.

The project is detailed in the [CityLines Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/msds-5x01/python-programming-for-data-science/blob/master/notebooks/CityLines.ipynb)

## Visualizaiton

1. Maps of 12 selected cities on a grid, e.g. 3 x 4 with each line in a different color (mostly solved above)
2. A bar plot of the total lengths of each city's tranit lines (mostly solved above)
3. Total length of the transit lines across all cities across time (km), or change per decade. 
4. World map of cities with an indication of the size of the transit city as a dot size or color.
5. come up with an interesting question and visualization
6. come up with an interesting question and visualization
7. come up with an interesting question and visualization
8. come up with an interesting question and visualization
